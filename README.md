## Development Choices/Technology Stack

### React

I chose React for its component-based architecture and efficient reactivity, which helped speed up feature development. While I used React here, I'm also proficient in building similar apps with Vanilla JS, demonstrating a solid grasp of JavaScript fundamentals.

### TypeScript

TypeScript was used for its strong typing and compile-time error checking, which improved code reliability and maintainability.

### CSS

Vanilla CSS was used to highlight my understanding of CSS fundamentals. I'm also skilled in using Tailwind CSS for a utility-first approach when appropriate.

### Redux Toolkit

I selected Redux Toolkit for its maturity and industry adoption. However, I'm also familiar with modern alternatives like Zustand, which would be equally viable depending on project needs.
